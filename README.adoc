== Building Envoy Binary CentOS6.4
NOTE: Tested on CentOS 6.4

* Update system gcc to version 4.9.2

   Delete all repos under /etc/yum.repo.d/ directory. replace with original link:CentOS-Base.repo[repo]

[source shell]
-----
   cd /etc/pki/rpm-gpg
   wget http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/scl/RPM-GPG-KEY-cern

   cd /etc/yum.repos.d
   wget http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/scl/slc6-scl.repo

   yum install -y devtoolset-3-gcc-c++

   # switch to new gcc
   source /opt/rh/devtoolset-3/enable
   gcc -v

* Then follow the bellowing steps under CentOS7

== Building Envoy Binary CentOS7

The envoy binary is built using the accompanying Vagrantfile and the scripts available as part of the scripts directory. The Vagrant up command will provision a Centos7 machine with required tools and libraries to build envoy. The envoy build setup has been divided into two steps for convinence,

* `setup_tools.sh` - this script takes care of downloading and building the pre-requisite libraries that are required by `envoy` build
* `build_envoy.sh` - this script takes care of build envoy binary and after successful build it copies the binary to the `bin` directory from where Vagrant is run

So the typical steps to build the envoy binary will be as follows,

1. `vagrant up` - bring up the Vagrant box to build the binary, might take some time if you don't have 'centos/7' box locally
2. `vagrant ssh EnvoyBuilder`- get in to Envoy builder box
[[envoy-pre-req]]
3. `sh /vagrant/scripts/setup_tools.sh` - run the script to download and install pre-requsites for envoy,

NOTE: The above step might take a bit of time in building `gcc-4.9.4`

4. `sh /vagrant/scripts/build_envoy.sh` - this builds the actual `envoy` binary and copies the same to *bin* folder of the directory from where vagrant command is run


NOTE: In future the <<envoy-pre-req,Install pre-requisites>> step (*setup_tools.sh*) might not be requried to be run, as centos7 based Vagrant box will be available at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/vagrant[Atlas]. You can then just run build_envoy.sh without worrying on what dependencies that needs to be installed for building https://github.com/lyft/envoy[envoy]

[[build-docker-image]]
== Building Docker Image

The docker image for the binary built using the steps <<build-envoy-binary>>, can be done by running the command `docker build -t <your-tag> --rm .`  The command builds the required docker image, the docker image exposes a volume called `/etc/envoy` where the envoy configuration files could be placed.

=== Run examples

To run the envoy container with a confiuration file of your choice, run the following command

`docker run -d -v $CONFIG_FOLDER:/etc/envoy my/envoy envoy -c /etc/envoy/myconfig.json`

NOTE: more examples coming...
